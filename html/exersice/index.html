    <p>I am learning Full Stack Development</p>
    <p>
        Full-stack development refers to the practice of working on both the front-end (client side) and back-end (server side) of web applications. A full-stack developer is skilled in designing user interfaces, managing databases, handling server logic, and integrating APIs. <br> <hr>
         This role requires knowledge of various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend languages (like Node.js, Python, or Java), and database systems. Full-stack development enables professionals to build complete, functional web solutions from start to finish.
    </p>
    <p>I am enjoying it.</p>
