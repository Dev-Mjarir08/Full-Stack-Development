# 🌐 Introduction to HTML

### 🔹 What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.
It is the **standard language** used to create the structure of web pages. Every website you see (Google, YouTube, Facebook) uses HTML as its foundation.

---

### 🔹 Why HTML?

* It tells the browser **what content to display** (headings, paragraphs, images, links, videos, etc.).
* It organizes content in a **structured way**.
* It is the **first step** in web development (before CSS & JavaScript).

---

### 🔹 How HTML Works?

* HTML uses **tags** (keywords inside `< >`) to define elements.
* Tags usually come in **pairs**:

  * Opening tag → `<p>`
  * Closing tag → `</p>`
    Example:

  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  ```

### 🔹 Basic Structure of an HTML Page

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### 🔹 Explanation of Structure

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` → Defines the document as HTML5.
* `<html>` → Root element (everything is inside this).
* `<head>` → Contains info about the page (title, metadata, etc.).
* `<title>` → The text shown in the browser tab.
* `<body>` → Visible part of the webpage (headings, text, images, links).

👉 **In short:**
HTML = **Skeleton of a website**
CSS = **Style/Design (Clothes of skeleton)**
JavaScript = **Brain/Logic (Makes it interactive)**

Do you want me to make this **introduction of HTML** in a **student-friendly note format (with diagrams & tables)** or a **professional format (like documentation)**?
