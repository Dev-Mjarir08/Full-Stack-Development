    <p>Hello Everyone</p>
    <h2>My name is Multani Jarir.</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I am learning Full Stack Development</p>
    <p>
        Full-stack development refers to the practice of working on both the front-end (client side) and back-end (server side) of web applications. A full-stack developer is skilled in designing user interfaces, managing databases, handling server logic, and integrating APIs. <br> <hr>
         This role requires knowledge of various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, backend languages (like Node.js, Python, or Java), and database systems. Full-stack development enables professionals to build complete, functional web solutions from start to finish.
    </p>
    <p>I am enjoying it.</p>

    Full Stack Development is the practice of building both the front-end
    
    and back-end parts of a web application. It involves working with 
    
    technologies that control how a website looks and feels, as well as how it 
    
    works behind the scenes. Full stack developers are skilled in designing user 
    
    interfaces, managing databases, and creating server-side logic, making them 
    
    capable of developing complete web solutions.
